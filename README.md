# Nyan Keys Hardware Docs v0.8a
Hardware documentation for the Nyan keys keyboard. MIT licensed so feel free to build and modify these designs.

# Links to Firmware and FPGA Bitstream
Nyan Keys has 4 other repositories that go along with the hardware designs listed below
 - [FGPA Bitstream](https://github.com/russeree/nyan-keys-ice40hx4k-bitstream)
 - [STM32 Firmware](https://github.com/russeree/nyan-keys-stm32-firmware)
 - [Web Serial API GUI - hosted](https://russeree.github.io/)

# Schematics
Schematics are provided as a .pdf file and will up to date with the latest release of Nyan keys hardware.

# Where is the .brd file?
There currently is a deliberate choice to not release a .brd file with this as I don't intend to allow Nyan Keys board to be produced
commercially. As such I want to make sure the proper licenses are in place to do that. email admin@qrsnap.io if you are interested in
obtaining board files for personal use.

At the end of the day, I want to sell the boards that designed and don't want other commercial entities with a low barrier to entry
do the same.
