# Board Files
Board files are located under the board_files directory and were created in KiCad. These are licensed under

manufacturing of the board files for commercial purposes.

Personal use is completely premised for this so if you want to make one for yourself or mod it feel free!

If you would like to avoid the logistics of acquiring the parts and getting a board made. I can fabricate and assemble boards on request. Please just email admin@qrsnap.io.
